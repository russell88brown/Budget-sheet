# Workflow 20: Close Sprint

1. Confirm all planned items are in final state:
   - `done`, `deferred`, or `dropped`
2. Run full regression checks required by project policy.
3. Verify no uncommitted temporary/debug changes remain.
4. Prepare PR or merge summary with:
   - completed items
   - deferred scope
   - known risks
5. Fill `closeout.md` with release notes and validation evidence.
6. Confirm branch cleanup plan:
   - keep sprint branch or delete after merge
   - delete merged item branches
7. Capture next sprint carryover items with explicit rationale.

Exit criteria:
- Regression checks recorded.
- Sprint closeout notes complete.
- Remaining risks and carryover work documented.
