# Workflow 00: Start Sprint

1. Confirm sprint identifier and priority order for items.
2. Confirm base branch (`main` unless told otherwise).
3. Verify working tree is clean before branch operations.
4. Create or switch to sprint branch: `sprint/<sprint-id>`.
5. Pull latest base and rebase or merge per team policy.
6. Create sprint artifacts from templates if not already created:
   - `sprint-plan.md`
   - `closeout.md`
   - one `items/<item-id>.md` file per ticket
7. Fill sprint scope, definition of done, and quality gates in `sprint-plan.md`.
8. Mark each item `queued` with owner and acceptance criteria.

Exit criteria:
- Sprint artifacts exist.
- Branch strategy is documented.
- Item list is prioritized and actionable.
